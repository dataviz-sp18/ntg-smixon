Using the `tidycensus` package, I wanted to look at some different demographics for the state of Michigan. Interestingly, Detroit seems to stand apart across each variable I looked at for this assignment. For my final project, I plan to look more closely at Detroit. I thought it was important to first look at the state as a whole. 
I chose this graphical form because I think that demgraphic data is better represented spatially, at least when just trying to get a broader picture. 

To create this visualization, I used `tidycensus` and `leaflet`, both new to me. It took some time to understand the grammar of both commands, and I feel like the maps themselves are still pretty basic. My second challenge has been figuring out how to knit the `leaflet` objects into an html document (and a flexdashboard in my last assignment).
